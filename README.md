# IMUS
**What is an IMU?**

An inertial measurement unit (IMU) measures and reports raw or filtered angular rate and specific force/acceleration experienced by the object it is attached to. Data outputs for an IMU are typically body-frame accelerations, angular rates, and (optionally) magnetic field measurements.
